## 2026-10-10
- Phase 1: recorded binary facts (size 404, sha256 af29c17c4214aff6a0d86b83bb4052fb2ce230944066069c67be276654606c16,
  $VER "versionlib 34.1 (06 JUL 1988)", hunk map).  Disassembled with IRA 2.09 into
  work/; cross-checked header with objdump -h.
- Parsed RomTag (RTF_AUTOINIT, version 34, NT_LIBRARY), the
  AUTOINIT InitTable (dataSize 0x2c), the 4-entry absolute-long
  function table (Open/-6, Close/-12, Expunge/-18, Null/-24) and the
  InitStruct data.  No version_lib.fd exists in the NDK; all four
  vectors are the standard skeleton so names are unambiguous.
- Phase 2: wrote source/ (version_lib.s header+tables, version.c,
  endmodule.s, Makefile).  Absolute-long vector table
  means no genfunctab second pass is needed; the Makefile documents
  this.
- Verified: `make` produces a valid .library; RomTag fields, name/id
  strings, InitTable layout, InitStruct bytes and entry instruction
  are byte-identical to the original; vector order and semantics
  match the disassembly.
- Phase 3: populated this okf bundle.
- Status: FULL.
